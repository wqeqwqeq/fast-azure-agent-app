"""Tools for Agent Factory sub-agents.

This directory contains tool functions for dynamically generated sub-agents.
Tools are created by the /onboard skill as TODO stubs initially.

Each tool file follows this pattern:
- Function name matches the tool name in snake_case
- Parameters use Annotated type hints for LLM descriptions
- Return type is str (JSON formatted)
